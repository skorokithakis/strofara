# Strofara

This is the code for the strofara project. It detects turns and plays the classic, now,
audio clip from [Έλα Γιώργη](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAMdqfTuIIU).

Here's a video of the project that will explain nothing:

# License

There's no license here because I stole most of that code from an example post or
somewhere, and I don't know what the license there was. If you want to bother figuring
that out, please let me know so I can update this repo.
